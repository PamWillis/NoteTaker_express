# Description
    - This project was created to make keeping notes easy and accessable. It uses a Express.js backend. It saves information using a save and get data using a JSON file for it's database. Deployment was done thru Heroku (see deployment for link).
    - Understanding of api routes and html routes
    - By using unique ids I was able to track the notes in order to delete as needed.
    - app coding was used for GET, POST, and DELETE. This was tracked by using the uniqid module to give each item a unique id.
